## Description
A simple weather app made for testing and practicing Retrofit and RxJava. It uses a free demo version of OpenWeather API, hence "demo" in title. By the way, I don't recommend to use this project as your reference since this is one of my first Android apps so I bet it's too poorly designed to be a reference project. But if you still want to of course I don't mind :)

## Features
- Showing weather and forecast for current location 
- Creating a list of custom locations, showing its weather and forecast

## About me
I'm a beginner to programming and (at least at this point of time) developing applications for Android is just one of my hobbies. This application is my first training project, so the source code is pretty dirty, but I tried to follow the main principles of MVP architectural pattern.
